        <h1>About Me Guessing Game</h1>
    </main>
    <P>
        My name is Kenneth Harman. I hold a double BA in Management and HR Management. 
        I could be concidered a jack of all trades but a master of none. After owning my 
        own logistics company for a couple years I ended up closing the doors and taking 
        a entry level position at Boeing. Unfprtunately, this was a bad decision and I was 
        not able to migrate to an appropriate position to suite my financial needs and 
        expereince. <br></br> After desperately racking my brain to figure out the next step or 
        path in my life, I remembered how much I really like the tech industry from previous
        jobs working in Data Centers and ISPs. After a long discussion with my wife about 
        the future and my lack of solid career, I was able to convince her that I was
        going to chase my intrest in the Tech world! Soon thereafter I enrolled into Code 
        Fellows bootcamp. My ultimate goal is to knock this program out of the stadium
        and set myself up with a great future! See below for a full work experience and education 
        list.
